# Garrett Roell

I'm an assistant professor at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. My work is focused on metabolic regulation for efficient biofuel production from non-food crops. The goal is to connect genes and gene expression with fermentation outcomes. When relaxing, I enjoy playing and watching sports including football and pickleball.
