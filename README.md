# Garrett Roell

## I am a Chemical Engineering PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis. My thesis is focused on metabolic regulation for efficient biofuel production from non-food crops. The goal is to connect genes and gene expression with fermentation outcomes. When relaxing, I enjoy playing and watching sports including football, volleyball and pickleball.
